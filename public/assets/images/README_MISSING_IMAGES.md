# Missing Images for Community Feature

The following images are referenced in the community feature but need to be added:

## Required Images:
1. **handshake.jpg** - Used for post image examples
   - Path: `/assets/images/handshake.jpg`
   - Purpose: Photo post example

2. **steve-jobs-book.jpg** - Used for video thumbnail
   - Path: `/assets/images/steve-jobs-book.jpg`
   - Purpose: Video post thumbnail

## Fallback Behavior:
- All user avatars fall back to `Portrait_Placeholder.png` if image fails to load
- Community logos fall back to colored circles with initials
- Post images are hidden if they fail to load

## Note:
These images are currently using dummy paths. Replace with actual images when available or use alternative placeholder images.
